# cloud.aws_ops Validated Content Collection

This repository hosts the `cloud.aws_ops` Ansible Collection.

## Description

This collection is curated to provide users with a robust set of roles, playbooks, and rulebooks that simplify and streamline various AWS operations.

## Requirements

## Installation

To consume this Validated Content from Automation Hub, please ensure that you add the following lines to your ansible.cfg file.

```
[galaxy]
server_list = automation_hub

[galaxy_server.automation_hub]
url=https://cloud.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/
auth_url=https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token
token=<SuperSecretToken>
```
The token can be obtained from the [Automation Hub Web UI](https://console.redhat.com/ansible/automation-hub/token).

Once the above steps are done, you can run the following command to install the collection.

```
ansible-galaxy collection install cloud.aws_ops
```

## Use Cases

Once installed, you can reference the cloud.aws_ops collection content by its fully qualified collection name (FQCN), for example:

```yaml
  # The following example restores encryption to an existing AWS Cloudtrail trail using the enable_cloudtrail_encryption_with_kms role
  - hosts: all
    tasks:
      - name: Include 'enable_cloudtrail_encryption_with_kms' role
        ansible.builtin.include_role:
          name: cloud.aws_ops.enable_cloudtrail_encryption_with_kms
        vars:
          enable_cloudtrail_encryption_with_kms_trail_name: "{{ cloudtrail_name }}"
          enable_cloudtrail_encryption_with_kms_kms_key_id: "{{ kms_alias }}"

  # The following example uses the ``cloud.aws_ops.clone_on_prem_vm`` role to clone an existing VM on prem using the KVM hypervisor and the ``cloud.aws_ops.import_image_and_run_aws_instance`` role to import a local .raw image into an Amazon machine image (AMI) and run an AWS EC2 instance.

  - hosts: all
    tasks:
    - name: Import 'cloud.aws_ops.clone_on_prem_vm' role
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: cloud.aws_ops.clone_on_prem_vm
      vars:
        clone_on_prem_vm_source_vm_name: "{{ source_vm_name }}"
        clone_on_prem_vm_image_name: "{{ image_name }}"
        clone_on_prem_vm_uri: "{{ uri }}"
        clone_on_prem_vm_local_image_path: "{{ local_image_path }}"
        clone_on_prem_vm_overwrite: "{{ overwrite }}"
      delegate_to: kvm

    - name: Import 'cloud.aws_ops.import_image_and_run_aws_instance' role
      ansible.builtin.import_role:
        name: cloud.aws_ops.import_image_and_run_aws_instance
      vars:
        import_image_and_run_aws_instance_bucket_name: "{{ bucket_name }}"
        import_image_and_run_aws_instance_image_path: "{{ raw_image_path }}"
        import_image_and_run_aws_instance_instance_name: "{{ instance_name }}"
        import_image_and_run_aws_instance_instance_type: "{{ instance_type }}"
        import_image_and_run_aws_instance_import_image_task_name: "{{ import_image_task_name }}"
        import_image_and_run_aws_instance_keypair_name: "{{ keypair_name }}"
```

## Testing

The project uses `ansible-lint` and `black`.
Assuming this repository is checked out in the proper structure,
e.g. `collections_root/ansible_collections/cloud/aws_ops/`, run:

```shell
  tox -e linters
```

Sanity and unit tests are run as normal:

```shell
  ansible-test sanity
```

If you want to run cloud integration tests, ensure you log in to the cloud:

```shell
# using the "default" profile on AWS
  aws configure set aws_access_key_id     my-access-key
  aws configure set aws_secret_access_key my-secret-key
  aws configure set region                eu-north-1

  ansible-test integration [target]
```
